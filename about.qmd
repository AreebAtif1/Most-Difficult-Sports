---

Hi! My name is Areeb Atif, and I’m a high schooler from the Garden State (New Jersey).

You can see this project and much more at my github, https://github.com/AreebAtif1.

I made this project because I like sports and am interested in physical activity. If you want to see more details about my project, here is my github repo - https://github.com/AreebAtif1/Most-Difficult-Sports

This project was created as a part of Kane’s Data Sciece Bootcamp - https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/.
